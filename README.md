It seems that XGB algorithm is performing better than Lasso regression, Linear Regression,
Feed forward neural network However, the time of training the model for lasso regression is 
by far less than the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGB). But here we care only for the 
performance factor instead of time factor.
